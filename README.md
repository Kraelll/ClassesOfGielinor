# Classes of Gielinor
Adds RPG-esque classes to Runescape to give you further limitations on your account. This plugin was intended to be used for group-based challenges.

# Classes
Currently there are a handful of classes, some which are familiar and some which may be a bit more tongue-in-cheek.
* (None - A vanilla Runescape player experience. Full access to prayer and spellcasting, and no items are restricted.)

* **Artificer** - A tinkerer, inventory, and master of craft. They create everything and anything that is needed. They prefer tools to weapons.
* **Barbarian** - A savage warrior who prides themselves on their strength. They prefer big, heavy weaponry over flimsy swords and bows.
* **Bard** - A master of social encounters through their music. Whilst not the most hardy, their magical abilities are on par with the most elite Wizards.
* **Chef** - An expert of the cooking skill. Whilst they can cook up a storm, they shouldn't be relied upon for fighting... Most weapons past a butterknife are beyond them.
* **Cleric** - A master of the healing magics, their power is usually bestowed by the Gods. Perhaps they may benefit from the Lunar Spellbook?
* **Druid** - A protector of the forest and masters of natural magics. They dismiss most violent things and instead rely on magic to aide.
* **Fighter** - A cunning warrior whose expertise in weapons is vast. Nice and simple, does what it says on the tin.
* **Monk** - A devout follower of the Gods who prefers to rely on their faith when it comes to combat, though they do use blessed weaponry from time to time.
* **Necromancer** - A master of magics surrounding the dead. The Arceuus Spellbook is definitely their ally, but don't rely on any help from the Gods. They don't take kindly.
* **Paladin** - Brutal warriors who care not for magic, but pray for their strength and vitality. They favour weapons representative of the Gods of Gielinor.
* **Ranger** - A scout and protector of the land. They tend to favour a bow and arrow over a sword, and experts of traversing nature.
* **Rogue** - A discreet assailant whose priorities are to get in and out quickly. They prefer concealed weaponry and long range equipment if possible.
* **Warlock** - A spellcaster who obtains their power from a patron, forever bound as their servant. Their magical ability and destiny is locked to their master.
* **Wizard** - A master spellcaster of all areas, and sometimes avid followers of the Gods. They tend to rely on staves for everything... Even melee combat.

# Restrictions
There are three main restrictions that are placed on each class:
* **Combat** - Weaponry and equipment will vary from class to class. Some classes will allow you to use certain melee, ranged, and magical weapons - but rarely all.
* **Spellcasting** - Not every class in Gielinor is attuned to magic, and therefore some classes will have spells locked away. This includes Teleportation spells (sorry!)
* **Prayer** - There are those that do not worship the Gods of the world, and therefore get no blessings from above. This includes overhead prayers.

Please note that these restrictions can be overridden in the plugin configuration menu in RuneLite. Feel free to suggest any extra classes you would like adding and recommendations on how to improve/rebalance the ones already made.
