# Classes of Gielinor
Adds RPG-esque classes to Runescape to give you further limitations on your account. This plugin was intended to be used for group-based challenges.

# Classes
Currently there are a handful of classes, some which are familiar and some which may be a bit more tongue-in-cheek.
* None - A vanilla Runescape player experience. Full access to prayer and spellcasting, and no items are restricted.
* Chef - An expert of the cooking skill. Whilst they can cook up a storm, they shouldn't be relied upon for fighting... Most weapons past a butterknife are beyond them.
* Cleric - A master of the healing magics, their power is usually bestowed by the Gods. Perhaps they may benefit from the Lunar Spellbook?
* Lumberjack - An expert woodcutter and child of the forest. Brilliant for starting fires, but tied to their Axes and reluctant towards the magical elements of the world.
* Necromancer - A master of magics surrounding the dead. The Arceuus Spellbook is definitely their ally, but don't rely on any help from the Gods. They don't take kindly.
* Paladin - Brutal warriors who care not for magic, but pray for their strength and vitality. They favour weapons representative of the Gods of Gielinor.
* Ranger - A scout and protector of the land. They tend to favour a bow and arrow over a sword, and experts of traversing nature.
* Wizard - A master spellcaster of all areas, and sometimes avid followers of the Gods. They tend to rely on staves for everything... Even melee combat.
